----------------------------------------------------
This project is developed as a part of the Zappos Android application internship challenge.

Description:
----------------------------------------------------
The android application searches any product in Zappos using the Zapoos REST API.
Once the product list is received, the first product is displayed in a product page with an
cart adding option using a floating action button.

Implementation:
-----------------------------------------------------
MVC design pattern is followed with Android data binding to display the product details in the
product page. Retrofit library is used send the REST request and receive the response. Gson
library is used to parse the response and generate product model. 

The UI is developed using Android material design guidelines. 
Picasso library is used for rendering the thumbnail images in product activity.

Here are the library versions used.
1. Retrofit: 2.0.2
2. Gson: 2.6.2
3. Picasso: 2.3.3
